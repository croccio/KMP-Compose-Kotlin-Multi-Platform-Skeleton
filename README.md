### Buildable projects for Android, iOS, desktop, web
The project is based on KMP - Compose framework, so we use kotlin for the business logic and compose to build the UI.
As you can see in the project structure we have on module called _composeApp_ with five submodule:
- **commonMain**: contains the common code (business logic and UI) for all platforms
- **androidMain**: contains the Android project that use the common code
- **desktopMain**: contains the Desktop project then use the common code
- **iosMain**: contains the code that is built as a library to use by the _iosApp_
- **wasmJsMain**: contains the code that is built as a library used by the _web app_
